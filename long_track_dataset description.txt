The file is a standard HDF5 file with the following structure:

behavioral data:
behavior/linear_position : vector of rat positions on the 10m long track (linearized with respect to the track start) in centimeters
behavior/linear_velocity : vector of (smoothed) run velocity in cm/s
behavior/time : vector of times at which rat position was measured

general information:
info/description
info/experimenter
info/session : session identifier
info/subject : subject identifier

spike data for each tetrode (TT):
spikes/<TT>/amplitude : (n_spikes,4) array of spike amplitudes in microVolt
spikes/<TT>/clusterID : (n_spikes,) vector of cluster IDs (noise cluster = 0)
spikes/<TT>/time : (n_spikes,) vector of spike times in seconds
